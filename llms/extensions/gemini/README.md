# Gemini File Search Store Extension

A complete solution for managing Gemini's [File Search Stores](https://ai.google.dev/api/file-search), enabling **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** workflows with automatic document uploads, category organization, and bidirectional sync between your local database and Gemini's cloud storage.

Features include background processing, SHA-256 deduplication, state tracking, and a RESTful API for seamless integration.
It talks directly to Gemini's documented HTTP API and adds no Python dependencies beyond llms.py.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Document Management
- **Automatic Deduplication**: SHA-256 hash-based duplicate detection prevents redundant uploads
- **Category Organization**: Organize documents into logical categories for better management
- **Custom Metadata**: Track documents with ID, hash, and category metadata
- **State Tracking**: Monitor document states (PENDING, ACTIVE, FAILED) throughout their lifecycle

### Background Upload Worker
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Automatically processes pending uploads in the background
- **Auto-start on Upload**: Worker automatically starts when new documents are uploaded
- **Startup Processing**: Processes any pending uploads from previous sessions on extension startup
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently handles multiple documents in batches of 10
- **Automatic Metadata Updates**: Keeps filestore statistics up-to-date after uploads complete

### Smart Synchronization
- **Bidirectional Sync**: Identify documents missing from local or remote stores
- **Metadata Validation**: Detect and fix metadata mismatches between local and remote
- **Duplicate Detection**: Find and flag duplicate documents in remote stores
- **State Management**: Automatically update document states based on sync results
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive sync reports with counts and sample documents

### Custom MIME Type Support
- **Configurable Types**: Override MIME types for specific file extensions via environment variable
- **Markdown Extensions**: Pre-configured support for mdx, l, ss, sc extensions as text/markdown
- **Upload Optimization**: Ensures correct MIME types for better search indexing

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

To use this extension, you must configure your Gemini API key.

1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Add it to your environment variables or `.env` file:

#### Required
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# or
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Both are checked, with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` taking precedence — matching the `google` provider's
own precedence, so configuring chat is enough to enable this extension too. If neither is set
the extension logs `GOOGLE_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY is not configured` and disables itself.

#### Optional
```bash
# Override MIME types for specific file extensions (comma-separated)
# Format: extension:mime/type,extension:mime/type
GEMINI_UPLOAD_MIME_TYPES="mdx:text/markdown,ss:text/markdown"
```

### Database Storage
The extension automatically creates a SQLite database at:
```
.llms/user/default/gemini/gemini.sqlite
```

### File Cache
Uploaded files are stored in the cache directory with SHA-256 hash-based filenames:
```
~/.llms/cache/[hash_prefix]/[hash].[ext]
~/.llms/cache/[hash_prefix]/[hash].info.json
```

## API Endpoints

### Filestore Management

#### Query Filestores
```
GET /filestores?take=50&skip=0&sort=-id&q=search_term
```
Query parameters:
- `take`: Number of results (default: 50, max: 1000)
- `skip`: Offset for pagination
- `sort`: Sort order (`-id`, `id`, `failed`)
- `q`: Search by display name
- `null`: Comma-separated columns that should be NULL
- `not_null`: Comma-separated columns that should NOT be NULL

#### Create Filestore
```
POST /filestores
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "displayName": "My Documents"
}
```

#### Delete Filestore
```
DELETE /filestores/{id}
```
Deletes the filestore and all associated documents (uses `force: true`).

#### Get Filestore Categories
```
GET /filestores/{id}/categories
```
Returns categories with document counts and total sizes.

#### Sync Filestore Documents
```
POST /filestores/{id}/sync
```
Synchronizes local documents with remote Gemini file search store. Returns detailed report:
```json
{
  "Missing from Local": { "count": 0, "docs": [] },
  "Missing from Gemini": { "count": 2, "docs": ["category/file1.pdf"] },
  "Missing Metadata": { "count": 0, "docs": [] },
  "Metadata Mismatch": { "count": 1, "docs": ["category/file2.txt"] },
  "Unmatched Fields": { "count": 3, "docs": ["category/file3.md"] },
  "Duplicate Documents": { "count": 0, "docs": [] },
  "Summary": {
    "Local Documents": 45,
    "Remote Documents": 43,
    "Matched Documents": 43
  }
}
```

#### List Remote Documents
```
GET /filestores/{id}/documents
```
Fetches current state of all documents from Gemini API.

### Document Management

#### Upload Documents
```
POST /filestores/{id}/upload?category=my_category&sourceUrl=https://docs.acme.com/guide
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: [binary file data]
file: [binary file data]
...
```
Uploads one or more files to the filestore. Documents are:
1. Hashed (SHA-256) for deduplication
2. Saved to cache directory
3. Added to local database
4. Queued for background upload to Gemini

`category` and `sourceUrl` can also be sent as **form fields**, in which case they apply to every
file that follows them in the request until the next one overrides them. This lets a single
request carry a whole crawl, each page with its own public URL:

```
POST /filestores/1/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

category: guides
sourceUrl: https://docs.acme.com/guides/auth
file: auth.md
sourceUrl: https://docs.acme.com/guides/limits
file: limits.md
```

`sourceUrl` is the page a reader should be sent to. It's stored on the document, pushed to Gemini
as custom metadata, and used to link citations — so an answer points at the customer's live docs
page instead of a download of the cached upload.

#### Query Documents
```
GET /documents?filestoreId=1&take=50&skip=0&sort=-id
```
Query parameters:
- `filestoreId`: Filter by filestore
- `category`: Filter by category
- `take`, `skip`, `sort`: Pagination and sorting
- `q`: Search by display name
- `ids_in`: Comma-separated IDs
- `displayNames`: Filter by display names
- `null`, `not_null`: Column filters
- Sort options: `-id`, `uploading`, `failed`, `issues`

#### Delete Document
```
DELETE /documents/{id}
```
Deletes document from both local database and Gemini (handles 404s gracefully).

#### Retry Upload
```
POST /documents/{id}/upload
```
Manually retry uploading a failed document. Waits for upload to complete and returns updated document state.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Filestore
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ext/gemini/filestores \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"displayName": "Technical Documentation"}'
```

### Uploading Documents with Categories
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ext/gemini/filestores/1/upload?category=guides \
  -F "file=@guide1.pdf" \
  -F "file=@guide2.pdf"
```

### Syncing Documents
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ext/gemini/filestores/1/sync
```

### Querying Failed Uploads
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/ext/gemini/documents?sort=failed&not_null=error"
```

### Querying by Category
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/ext/gemini/documents?filestoreId=1&category=guides&sort=-id&take=20"
```

## How It Works

### Upload Process
1. **File Reception**: Multipart file upload with optional category
2. **Hashing**: SHA-256 hash calculated for deduplication
3. **Deduplication Check**: Existing documents with same hash are deleted
4. **Local Storage**: File saved to cache directory with hash-based filename
5. **Database Record**: Document metadata stored in SQLite
6. **Worker Trigger**: Background upload worker starts automatically
7. **Gemini Upload**: Worker uploads file to Gemini file search store
8. **Metadata Update**: Document updated with Gemini response data

### Background Worker
The upload worker:
- Starts automatically on extension initialization to process pending uploads
- Starts automatically when new documents are uploaded
- Processes up to 10 documents per batch
- Polls Gemini operations until completion
- Updates filestore statistics after batch completion
- Handles errors gracefully and stores error messages
- Stops automatically when queue is empty

### Synchronization Process
The sync endpoint:
1. **Fetches Local Documents**: Queries all documents for the filestore
2. **Builds Hash Lookup**: Creates maps by hash and name for fast matching
3. **Lists Remote Documents**: Fetches all documents from Gemini API
4. **Matching Logic**:
   - Matches by custom metadata hash (preferred)
   - Falls back to matching by document name
5. **Detects Issues**:
   - Documents in Gemini but not in local database
   - Documents in local database but not in Gemini
   - Documents missing custom metadata (id, hash, category)
   - Metadata mismatches (wrong id or hash in metadata)
   - Field mismatches (name, size, mime type, etc.)
   - Duplicate hashes in remote store
6. **Updates States**: Automatically updates document states based on findings
7. **Returns Report**: Detailed breakdown with counts and sample filenames

### MIME Type Handling
- Default MIME type determined by file extension using Python's `mimetypes`
- Custom overrides via `GEMINI_UPLOAD_MIME_TYPES` environment variable
- JSON files uploaded without explicit MIME type (Gemini API limitation workaround)
- Custom MIME types applied during upload configuration

## Database Schema

## Integration with Gemini AI

This extension uses Google's Gemini AI [File Search API](https://ai.google.dev/api/file-search) to:
- Create and manage file search stores
- Upload documents for AI-powered search
- Attach custom metadata for enhanced organization
- Query document status and retrieve results

Once documents are uploaded, they can be referenced in Gemini chat sessions using the `fileSearch` tool, enabling the AI to search through your document collection and provide informed responses based on your content.

### Citations

Every answer grounded in a file search store carries its sources:

- **Inline `[n]` markers** are placed on the sentences they support, using the byte ranges Gemini
  returns in `groundingSupports`. Clicking one opens that document's `sourceUrl` (falling back to
  the cached upload). Markers are added at render time — the stored message stays exactly what the
  model wrote, so copying an answer copies clean text.
- **A numbered Sources list** under each answer, with an expandable excerpt of the retrieved text.

Sources are attached to the **message** that cited them rather than the thread, so scrolling back
through a conversation shows each answer with its own documents. They survive streaming: the
grounding metadata is merged as the response arrives rather than read from a final payload.

A span that can't be placed in the final text — a truncated or cancelled stream, or a response
split across multiple text parts — is dropped rather than guessed at, so the Sources list is still
shown but the inline markers for it are not.

## Authentication

Extension routes are not auth-gated by the server, and an anonymous caller resolves to the shared
(`user IS NULL`) scope. When auth is enabled, the endpoints that mutate state — creating, deleting,
uploading to, re-uploading and syncing — require a signed-in user and return `401` otherwise.
Reads are left open, since the null-user scope is the deliberate "shared with everyone here"
bucket.
